<ochosi> about the autocompletion: why not just do a combobox-like/listview that pops up below the entry as in appfinder instead of that blue box (that looks fancy, but only offers one option)?
<ochosi> and why would anyone wanna disable that? and if yes, why would the option for it have to be in that dialog itself and not in a less obvious/obstructive place?
