    * Makefile.am: Refactored the app and renamed it sandboxutilsd.
    
    * sandboxfilechooserdialog.c, sandboxfilechooserdialog.h: GObject version of
    SandboxFileChooserDialog which allows for leaner code and better thread
    safety management, with an incomplete API (about as much as 0.2 available).
    
    * sandboxfilechooserdialogdbuswrapper.c, sandboxfilechooserdialogdbuswrapper.h:
    Headers for a wrapper to the SFCD class, which handles the DBus interface
    owning, receiving method calls and dispatching them to the actual SFCD
    objects. Currently uses a unique global client structure to store dialogs.
    
    * sandboxutilsclientmanager.c, sandboxutilsclientmanager.h: A placeholder
    for future client-related code, including managing a unique client across
    multiple DBus interfaces (SFCD and future widgets) and per-client security
    limits.

    * sandboxutilscommon.h: Name and version of app, name of base interface.
    
    * sandboxutilsd.c: Actual daemon, which sets up the watchdog, inits syslog,
    calls the DBus wrappers to get hold of interfaces and creates the temporary
    unique global client.
    
    * sandboxutilsmarshals.c, sandboxutilsmarshals.h, sandboxutilsmarshals.list:
    Marshals for my custom Gobjects signal, and a list to regenerate them.

    * server.*: API changes, supporting states, running, cancelling, creating
    and destroying dialogs, as well as basic mutex protection.

    * server.c, configure.ac: watchdog implementation
