    * sandboxutilsd.c: Shorter timeout for watchdog.

    * data/*: Removed old DBus service file since we'll use a systemd one.

    * Makefile.am, sandboxfilechooserdialoginterface.xml: Setup the basic
    building blocks for GDBus codegen, in order to maybe replace the complicated
    wrapper and also to provide a DBus interface to clients.

    * sandboxfilechooserdialog.h: Description of my API compared to the original
    one.
    * sandboxfilechooserdialog{.c,.h,dbuswrapper.c}: Almost all configuration
    methods exported on DBus now.

    * sandboxfilechooserdialog{.c,.h}: Most retrieval methods implemented in the
    underlying class, not exported yet (GDBus-codegen experimentation coming).
    
    * README: more API examples.

    * sandboxfilechooserdialog{.c,.h,dbuswrapper.c}: Implemented most basic
    methods.

    * README: More usage examples.

    * Makefile.am: Refactored the app and renamed it sandboxutilsd.
    
    * sandboxfilechooserdialog.c, sandboxfilechooserdialog.h: GObject version of
    SandboxFileChooserDialog which allows for leaner code and better thread
    safety management, with an incomplete API (about as much as 0.2 available).
    
    * sandboxfilechooserdialogdbuswrapper.c, sandboxfilechooserdialogdbuswrapper.h:
    Headers for a wrapper to the SFCD class, which handles the DBus interface
    owning, receiving method calls and dispatching them to the actual SFCD
    objects. Currently uses a unique global client structure to store dialogs.
    
    * sandboxutilsclientmanager.c, sandboxutilsclientmanager.h: A placeholder
    for future client-related code, including managing a unique client across
    multiple DBus interfaces (SFCD and future widgets) and per-client security
    limits.

    * sandboxutilscommon.h: Name and version of app, name of base interface.
    
    * sandboxutilsd.c: Actual daemon, which sets up the watchdog, inits syslog,
    calls the DBus wrappers to get hold of interfaces and creates the temporary
    unique global client.
    
    * sandboxutilsmarshals.c, sandboxutilsmarshals.h, sandboxutilsmarshals.list:
    Marshals for my custom Gobjects signal, and a list to regenerate them.

    * server.*: API changes, supporting states, running, cancelling, creating
    and destroying dialogs, as well as basic mutex protection.

    * server.c, configure.ac: watchdog implementation
