    * configure.ac: Version 0.5.0

    * server/*: Now using the new toolchain and reusing lib/*.c files to build.
    Builds, links and runs (however many invalid cast errors when running).

    * server/sandboxfilechooserdbuswrapper.c,lib/localfilechooserdialog.*: 
    Ported DBus wrapper to use lfcd_new_variant(), a new ctor for when a valist
    is not available.

    * lib/*filechooserdialog.c: Better constructor documentation.

    * autogen.sh,configure.ac,Makefile.am,*: Unified build toolchain.

    * sandboxutils.pc.in: pkg-config pc file.

    * lib/sandboxutilscommon.h.in: Now generated via configure.ac to avoid
    managing versioning in multiple places myself.

    * docs/*: Pointless agitation in Makefile.am, not meant to build at all yet.

2014-05-04  Steve Dodier-Lazaro  <sidnioulz@gmail.com>

    * server/sandboxfilechooserdialog.*: temporarily removed in favour of lib/.
    Tree is currently broken.

    * lib/localfilechooserdialog.*,lib/sandboxfilechooserdialog.*: now SFCD is a
    virtual class with a first implementation. LFCD implements the API by
    spawning a local GtkFileChooserDialog, which is the class used by the server
    implementation. Remote version to come.

    * lib/*: pushing the library's building blocks

    * server/sandboxfilechooserdialog.*: Rewrote SFCD API on the server to be
    more natural -- now fits the one to come in libsandboxutils.

    * server/sandboxfilechooserdialog.*: Wrote a full documentation of SFCD
    (mostly by copying it off GTK+ :D)

    * tests/*: Adding a temporary basic test with build instructions (may be
    broken in between commits).

    * */COPYING: Now under LGPLv3.

    * mockups/sfcd-autocompletion/*: Mockups for file chooser dialog currentname
    autocompletion.

    * *: Moving files around to prepare for a unique client/server/tests repo.
    Most code until now was in server/, will be split between server/ lib/ and
    tests/

    * sandboxfilechooserdialog.h: Added notes on the API extension I envision.

2014-05-02  Steve Dodier-Lazaro  <sidnioulz@gmail.com>

    * sandboxfilechooserdialog{.c,.h}: Forgot Set/GetDoOverwriteConfirmation and
    Set/GetCreateFolders.

2014-05-01  Steve Dodier-Lazaro  <sidnioulz@gmail.com>

    * sandboxutilscommon.h: Bumped version number for 0.4.

    * Makefile.am, configure.ac: --enable-debug switch now works.

    * sandboxfilechooserdialogdbuswrapper{.c,.h}: Now using the GDBus-codegen
    generated GObject and InterfaceSkeleton inside the wrapper. Also implemented
    the other functions that were already in the SFCD class.
    
    * sandboxfilechooserdialoginterface.xml: Exported the DBus interface of SFCD
    to a XML file.

    * sandboxutilsd.c: Shorter timeout for watchdog.

    * data/*: Removed old DBus service file since we'll use a systemd one.

    * Makefile.am, sandboxfilechooserdialoginterface.xml: Setup the building
    blocks for GDBus codegen, in order to replace the complicated wrapper and
    also to provide a DBus interface to clients.

2014-04-30  Steve Dodier-Lazaro  <sidnioulz@gmail.com>

    * sandboxfilechooserdialog.h: Description of my API compared to the original
    one.
    * sandboxfilechooserdialog{.c,.h,dbuswrapper.c}: Almost all configuration
    methods exported on DBus now.

    * sandboxfilechooserdialog{.c,.h}: Most retrieval methods implemented in the
    underlying class, not exported yet (GDBus-codegen experimentation coming).
    
    * README: more API examples.
    
2014-04-29  Steve Dodier-Lazaro  <sidnioulz@gmail.com>

    * sandboxfilechooserdialog{.c,.h,dbuswrapper.c}: Implemented most basic
    methods.

    * README: More usage examples.

2014-04-28  Steve Dodier-Lazaro  <sidnioulz@gmail.com>

    * Makefile.am: Refactored the app and renamed it sandboxutilsd.
    
    * sandboxfilechooserdialog.c, sandboxfilechooserdialog.h: GObject version of
    SandboxFileChooserDialog which allows for leaner code and better thread
    safety management, with an incomplete API (about as much as 0.2 available).
    
    * sandboxfilechooserdialogdbuswrapper.c, sandboxfilechooserdialogdbuswrapper.h:
    Headers for a wrapper to the SFCD class, which handles the DBus interface
    owning, receiving method calls and dispatching them to the actual SFCD
    objects. Currently uses a unique global client structure to store dialogs.
    
    * sandboxutilsclientmanager.c, sandboxutilsclientmanager.h: A placeholder
    for future client-related code, including managing a unique client across
    multiple DBus interfaces (SFCD and future widgets) and per-client security
    limits.

    * sandboxutilscommon.h: Name and version of app, name of base interface.
    
    * sandboxutilsd.c: Actual daemon, which sets up the watchdog, inits syslog,
    calls the DBus wrappers to get hold of interfaces and creates the temporary
    unique global client.
    
    * sandboxutilsmarshals.c, sandboxutilsmarshals.h, sandboxutilsmarshals.list:
    Marshals for my custom Gobjects signal, and a list to regenerate them.

2014-04-27  Steve Dodier-Lazaro  <sidnioulz@gmail.com>

    * server.*: API changes, supporting states, running, cancelling, creating
    and destroying dialogs, as well as basic mutex protection.

    * server.c, configure.ac: watchdog implementation

    * *: initial commit
