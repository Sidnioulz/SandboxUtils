# Server
- Build demo server with "stateful" dialog (internally, a vanilla GtkFileChooserDialog)
- Add full vanilla API to server via a DBus interface
- Build GtkFileChooserSandboxDialog that uses this DBus interface to redirect all calls
- Strenghten server with client management, per-client limits, and hooks
- Really, if the dialog receives a destroyed signal I should kill the SFCD
- Look up gtk_window_set_transient_for (GTK_WINDOW (result), parent);

#Hardening
- Watchdog on the server, with a functioning DBus/systemd socket activation
- Per-client server sub-process, API hardening and
- Build a properlike sandbox, marra!

# And giving it love
- Share DBus
- XDG folders work
- All exposed FS can be made read-write, kept consist
- Extend to use/cases, discuss with DE on integration
