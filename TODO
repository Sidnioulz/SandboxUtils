# Library
- Finish GtkFileChooserDialog API (selections and filters)
- Design new preview widgets, new extra widgets, new autocompletion, etc. (see sfcd.h)
- Do signal management and property passing in SFCD
- Write Remote FCD
- Really, if the dialog receives a destroyed signal I should kill the SFCD

# Server
- Client management
- Look up gtk_window_set_transient_for (GTK_WINDOW (result), parent) for wayland part
- Strenghten server with client management, per-client limits, and hooks

#Hardening
- Watchdog on the server, with a functioning DBus/systemd socket activation
- Per-client server sub-process?
- Build a properlike sandbox and launcher!

# And giving it love
- Share DBus mgt between APIs
- Other GTK+ classes!
- glib-mkenums
- XDG folders work
- All exposed FS can be made read-write, kept consist
- Extend to use/cases, discuss with DE on integration
- Replace INT by ENUM over DBus and in signal marshallers?
